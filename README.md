## Hi there, I'm Maisy. &nbsp;  <img width="32" height="32" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b97e16b5-13d4-43e0-ae78-1f1d708393df" />

I enjoy exploring data, building machine learning models, and working on projects that help me grow as an engineer and researcher. I am currently a Master's Candidate for Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS) at Columbia University. I am pursuing a dual degree with the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University for Master in Public Administration (MPA). 

I’m especially passionate about AI: how it works, how to build with it, and how to use it responsibly. I like creating models and systems that have real-world value.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on LLM Reinforcement Learning for mental health at Lyslle AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NLP, LLM, and Databases
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/maisysong">Linkedin</a> or email me to mhs2229@columbia.edu
  
Thanks for stopping by.
